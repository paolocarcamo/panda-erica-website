              </em>
            </strong>{" "}
            is a Filipino-American children's book designer at HarperCollins
            Publishers during the day. By night, she is a freelance illustrator,
            designer, and storyteller. Born and raised in Kissimmee, FL she now
            calls Brooklyn, NY her home.
            <br />
            <br />
            After spending a short, yet enjoyable time in men's fashion design,
            Erica went on to dabble in educational toy and product design for
            children. She meandered through the world of freelance illustration
            for a year before she found her calling in designing children's
            books. She illustrated a wonderful book written by Annie Fox called
            The Girls' Q&A Book on Friendship that can be found on Amazon,
            Barnes & Nobles and in select bookstores across the US, contributed
            over 40 stickers to The Future Is Ours: Feminist Stickers to Express
            Yourself available on Amazon and Barnes & Nobles, and illustrated
            her debut picture book, Mighty May Wonâ€™t Cry Today available on
            Amazon and{" "}
            <a href="https://www.MightyMayBooks.com">www.MightyMayBooks.com</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            She enjoys getting lost in a good story, be it in the form of books,
            comics, manga, broadway musicals and plays, movies or television
            shows. She likes to play outside, practice yoga, throw a frisbee
            around and kayak with her energetic jack russell terrier, Maxwell
            Parrish. Erica has an unhealthy obsession with bows, pandas, Hello
            Kitty, and desserts of all kinds.
            <br />

            Feel free to contact her for any commissions, collaborative
            projects, or just to say 'Hello'.
